  Using Node, this app generates HTML elements for a website team page custom to the userâ€™s inputs. Following the instructions on the command line, the user can create a manager, engineer, intern contact cards formatted with the Bootstrap CSS framework.
  ## Installation

  ## Usage
  After installing all necessary packages, run `node app.js`. You will then be prompted to add information relevant to the manager. After completion you will have the following option to either add an intern, add an engineer, or to finish your team. Navigating to and selection the intern option enables you to custom define a new intern element in your final HTML page. Selecting the engineer option will enable you to custom define a new engineer element in your final HTML page. Both of these options are repeatable as many times as necessary for your team. Once you have entered all of your necessary information, selecting the Finish team option will finalize and print out your inputs into HTML elements. To access the final product, move to the Output directory to view your custom page!
